This is a nearly unbeatable Naughts and Crosses game (or tic tac toe if you are that way inclined).

To play, clone the repo, `cd` into it, run `bundle` then run `bundle exec ruby bin/curses.rb` in the root of the project directory.

- Add alpha beta prunning
- Comp vs Comp
- Make a gem (and publish)
